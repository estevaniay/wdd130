    <h2>Hello Everyone!</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Estevania Yolanda Apuriyau, you can call me Vania. I am 23
      years old and I live in Indonesia. I'm the only child in my family. I'm
      currently pursuing a degree in BS Software Development, and this is my
      first semester at BYU-Idaho. I love traveling, singing, watching movies,
      editing videos and writing songs. I have been a member of the church for
      23 years and still counting. In my family, only me and my mother are
      members. I have completed my mission at the Indonesia Jakarta Mission in
      November 2021. I have also participated in the Asia Area Christmas
      Devotional as a singer representing Indonesia.

      As a Content Creator and Social Media Specialist, in-depth knowledge of
      technology is very important because it is very sustainable with social
      media. I am excited to embark on this journey together and look forward to
      building a great relationship with all of you. I am sure that through this
      class and the majors I take, I will become someone who is successful in my
      field and can work in any company. Glad to have the opportunity to get to
      know you all better.
